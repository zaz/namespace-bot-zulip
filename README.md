# Zulip Shell Bot

A Zulip bot that runs shell commands on the machine it's hosted on and replies
with the output. Direct-message it a command, or @-mention it in a stream.

> ⚠️ **This is remote code execution over chat.** Anyone on the allowlist — or
> anyone who steals the bot's API key — gets a shell on the host. Run it as an
> unprivileged user, keep the allowlist tight, and never commit `zuliprc`.

## Setup

1. Create a **Generic bot** in Zulip: *Settings → Personal / Organization →
   Bots → Add a new bot*. Download its `zuliprc`.

2. Put the `zuliprc` next to `shell_bot.py` (or point `ZULIPRC` at it). See
   [zuliprc.example](zuliprc.example) for the format.

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set the allowlist and run:

   ```bash
   export SHELL_BOT_ALLOWED_SENDERS="you@example.com,teammate@example.com"
   python shell_bot.py
   ```

   On organizations that **hide real email addresses**, the API delivers dummy
   `user<id>@<realm>` addresses, so an email allowlist never matches. Allowlist
   numeric Zulip user IDs instead (shown on a user's profile in the Zulip UI):

   ```bash
   export SHELL_BOT_ALLOWED_SENDER_IDS="1193774,1200001"
   ```

   A sender is authorized if their email **or** user ID is allowlisted. The bot
   refuses to start if both allowlists are empty.

## Usage

Commands must start with `!` (configurable via `SHELL_BOT_PREFIX`); anything else
is ignored, so the bot stays quiet in normal conversation.

- **Direct message:** send the bot `!ls -la` — it replies in the DM.
- **Stream:** `@**shell-bot** !df -h` — it replies in the same topic.

### One shell per thread

Each Zulip thread (a stream topic, or a DM conversation) gets its **own
persistent bash session**, so state carries across commands within a thread and
threads are isolated from one another:

```
!cd /var/log      # in thread A
!pwd              -> /var/log          (thread A remembers)
!export TOKEN=abc
!echo $TOKEN      -> abc

# a different topic / DM is a completely separate shell:
!pwd              -> /                 (thread B, unaffected)
```

- `!:reset` — discard this thread's shell and start a fresh one.
- A command that hits the timeout resets that thread's shell (only that thread).
- Interactive commands (`sudo` prompts, `cat` with no args, `read`) don't hang —
  their stdin is `/dev/null`, so they get EOF immediately.
- Up to `SHELL_BOT_MAX_SESSIONS` shells are kept alive; the least-recently-used
  is evicted beyond that.

### Claude assistant (`?` prefix)

Messages prefixed with `?` are answered by Claude instead of the shell, with
per-thread conversation memory:

```
?summarize what df -h reported above
?now suggest which mount to clean up first   # same thread → Claude remembers
```

- Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Without it, `?` messages report that Claude is
  disabled; the shell (`!`) works regardless.
- `?:reset` clears this thread's Claude history (separate from `!:reset`).
- Defaults to `claude-opus-5`; tune with `SHELL_BOT_CLAUDE_*` (see the table).
- The API key is scrubbed from the per-thread shells, so `!env` can't read it.

> This is the Claude **Messages API** — a chat assistant with no tools. For an
> agent that actually *runs* commands, see the `%` mode below.

### Namespace agent (`%` prefix)

Messages prefixed with `%` drive a Claude **Managed Agent** session — one per
thread — that executes tools (bash, file ops, web) in an ephemeral **Namespace
Devbox**, via the [Claude-on-Namespace integration](https://namespace.so/docs/integrations/claude).
Anthropic runs the agent loop; Namespace runs the Devbox; the bot is the client
that relays messages into the Zulip thread.

```
%clone the repo, run the tests, and summarize failures
%now fix the first failure          # same thread → same session & Devbox
```

- Requires `SHELL_BOT_AGENT_ID` and `SHELL_BOT_ENVIRONMENT_ID` (from `devbox
  claude managed-agents setup-environment`), plus `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- The bot posts a "working…" ack, then the agent's reply. **Runs are autonomous
  and can take minutes**; the bot processes messages serially, so a long agent
  run blocks other bot messages until it finishes (`SHELL_BOT_AGENT_TIMEOUT`,
  default 300s, bounds the wait — the session keeps running in the console after).
- `%:reset` starts a fresh session (new Devbox) for the thread.
- Tool-approval prompts (`always_ask` policies) aren't serviced yet — the bot
  links you to the Anthropic console to continue those.

### Claude Code fleet (@-mention or DM)

@-mentioning the bot (or DMing it plain text) drives a headless **Claude Code** session — one per
thread — running directly on the bot's machine. Unlike `%` (Anthropic runs the
agent loop), here the bot host runs everything, so the agent can use whatever
is installed there. With the Namespace `devbox` CLI authenticated on the host,
that includes **spawning ephemeral worker devboxes** for large parallel tasks:

```
@zulip-bot render a 4000x4000 Mandelbrot using 4 workers and post progress
@zulip-bot now stitch the tiles and expire the workers   # same thread → same session
```

- Requires the `claude` CLI on PATH (plus `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` /
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` if you point it at a gateway). Runs with
  `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` in `SHELL_BOT_FLEET_CWD` — treat that
  directory's `CLAUDE.md` as the agent's standing orders (worker sizing,
  cleanup rules, what's off-limits).
- The bot posts a "working…" ack, then the final reply. Runs happen in a
  background thread, so other messages keep working; `SHELL_BOT_FLEET_TIMEOUT`
  (default 600s) bounds a turn.
- Mention the bot with `:reset` to start a fresh Claude Code session for the thread.

## Deploy on Namespace (namespace.so)

Run the bot inside a container on a Namespace VM that's created automatically.
The bot connects *outbound* to Zulip (long-poll), so the VM needs no inbound
ingress — the exposed thing is that VM's shell, reachable through the bot.

One-time:

```bash
nsc login
nsc docker login   # lets the remote builder push to your workspace registry
```

Configure and deploy:

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # fill in ZULIP_* and SHELL_BOT_ALLOWED_SENDERS
./deploy.sh
```

`deploy.sh` builds the image with the Namespace remote builder, pushes it to
`nscr.io/<workspace>/zulip-shell-bot`, then runs `nsc run` — which **creates a
fresh ephemeral VM automatically** and starts the bot on it, injecting the
Zulip credentials and allowlist as env vars (no secrets baked into the image).

Manage the running VM:

```bash
nsc list                 # find the instance id
nsc logs <instance-id>   # view bot output
nsc ssh <instance-id>    # shell into the VM directly
nsc destroy <instance-id># tear it down
```

### Lifetime / keeping it alive

`nsc run` VMs are **ephemeral** — they're destroyed when `--duration` elapses
(default `12h` in `deploy.sh`; set `DURATION=24h` etc.). When the VM dies the bot
stops. To keep a bot running continuously, re-run `./deploy.sh` on a schedule
(e.g. cron / a Namespace GitHub Actions runner) so a fresh VM is provisioned
each cycle, or raise `DURATION`. Each new VM is clean — nothing persists between
runs unless you attach a `persistent` volume.

| `SHELL_BOT_CLAUDE_PREFIX` | `?` | Prefix that routes a message to Claude |
| `SHELL_BOT_CLAUDE_MODEL` | `claude-opus-5` | Claude model id |
| `SHELL_BOT_CLAUDE_EFFORT` | `medium` | Reasoning effort: low/medium/high/xhigh/max |
| `SHELL_BOT_CLAUDE_MAX_TOKENS` | `4096` | Max reply tokens |
| `SHELL_BOT_CLAUDE_MAX_HISTORY` | `20` | Messages kept per thread before trimming |

| `SHELL_BOT_CLAUDE_SYSTEM` | *(built-in)* | System prompt for the assistant |

## Security notes

- Commands run through `/bin/bash -c`, so full shell syntax (pipes, `&&`,
  redirects) works — and so does anything destructive. The allowlist is the only
  gate.
- Consider running under a dedicated low-privilege user, in a container, or in a
  VM you don't mind losing.
- Rotate the bot's API key if you suspect it leaked.
